# Project Title: Cars Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, you will work on real-world data analysis tasks using Python. The project involves performing data cleaning, filtering, and manipulation to extract meaningful insights from a dataset containing information about cars. Python's Pandas library is used extensively to accomplish these tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information about various car makes, their origins, weights, MPG (Miles Per Gallon), and more. The dataset is analyzed to answer specific questions related to car characteristics and performance.

## Key Objectives

The following tasks are addressed in this project using Python:

1. **Instruction (For Data Cleaning):** Find all Null Values in the dataset. If there is any null value in any column, fill it with the mean of that column.
2. **Question (Based on Value Counts):** Check what are the different types of 'Make' in the dataset and what is the count (occurrence) of each 'Make' in the data?
3. **Instruction (Filtering):** Show all the records where 'Origin' is Asia or Europe.
4. **Instruction (Removing unwanted records):** Remove all the records (rows) where 'Weight' is above 4000.
5. **Instruction (Applying function on a column):** Increase all the values of the 'MPG_City' column by 3.

## Commands and Functions Used

To perform these tasks, the following Python commands and functions were used:

* `import pandas as pd` - To import the Pandas library.
* `pd.read_csv()` - To import the CSV file into the Jupyter notebook.
* `head()` - Displays the first N rows in the data (default is 5).
* `shape` - Shows the total number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
* `df.isnull().sum()` - Detects the missing values in each column of the DataFrame.
* `fillna()` - Fills the null values in a column with a specified value, such as the mean.
* `value_counts` - Shows all unique values in a column along with their counts. It can be applied to a single column only.
* `isin()` - Filters the DataFrame to show all records that include particular elements.
* `apply()` - Applies a function along any axis of the DataFrame.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library installed.
2. Open the `Cars_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the data cleaning, filtering, and analysis tasks.

## Results

Through this project, you will gain insights into car data by performing tasks like handling missing values, filtering data based on specific conditions, removing unwanted records, and applying functions to modify data. These tasks are fundamental in the data cleaning and preparation phase of data analysis.

## Conclusion

The Cars Data Analysis project demonstrates the practical use of Python for data manipulation and analysis, focusing on data cleaning, filtering, and modification techniques. By completing this project, you will better understand how to prepare and analyze real-world datasets using Python.
