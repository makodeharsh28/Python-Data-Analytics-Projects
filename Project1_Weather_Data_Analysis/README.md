# Project Title: Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to perform data analysis using Python. The project involves answering specific questions using a real-world weather dataset. Python commands are utilized to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, providing insights into various weather conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes weather data with variables such as Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and more. The dataset allows for extensive exploration and analysis of weather patterns.

## Key Objectives

The following questions are addressed in this project using Python:

1. **Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.**
2. **Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.**
3. **Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.**
4. **Find out all the Null Values in the data.**
5. **Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.**
6. **What is the mean 'Visibility'?**
7. **What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data?**
8. **What is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data?**
9. **Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.**
10. **Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.**
11. **What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?**
12. **What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?**
13. **Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog.**
14. **Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.**
15. **Find all instances when:**
    - 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50' 
    - or 'Visibility is above 40'

## Commands and Functions Used

To answer these questions, the following Python commands and functions were used:

* `head()` - Displays the first N rows in the data (default is 5).
* `shape` - Shows the total number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
* `index` - Provides the index of the DataFrame.
* `columns` - Lists the names of each column.
* `dtypes` - Displays the data type of each column.
* `unique()` - Shows all unique values in a column.
* `nunique()` - Displays the total number of unique values in each column.
* `count` - Counts the total number of non-null values in each column.
* `value_counts` - Shows all unique values in a column along with their counts.
* `info()` - Provides basic information about the DataFrame.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library installed.
2. Open the `Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to carry out the data analysis.

## Results

This project provided valuable insights into weather conditions, such as identifying unique wind speeds, analyzing weather patterns, and calculating statistical metrics like mean, variance, and standard deviation for different weather conditions.

## Conclusion

The Weather Data Analysis project demonstrated the practical application of Python for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling real-world datasets. By answering specific queries, the project showcased how data analysis can be utilized to extract meaningful information from raw data.
